The majority of household bots available now only perform specific tasks, such as cleaning or playing, but we can add more functionalities without considerably increasing hardware (which won’t increase the cost). The bot will assist with all daily tasks, including child care, cleaning, security, and many other things. Its usability will rise and the price will drop thanks to numerous simple and creative innovations like DIY guides and detachable parts. Also, we’ll make it programmable and customizable by users so they can play around with it, learn from it, and add new features.</td>

Nevertheless, the visual data must be improved because red quickly fades and turns the photos blue, and the brightness of the photographs is also impacted by minute variations in the object’s altitude above the seafloor. A noisy and distorted visual data is caused by variables including refraction and absorption, suspended particles in the water, and colour distortion.</td>
